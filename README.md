## How to Use

### Via Conan

This library is packaged with [Conan](https://conan.io/),
and available via
[package registry in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/MusicScience37Projects/utility-libraries/cpp-stat-bench/-/packages).

To use this library,
add the package
`cpp_stat_bench/<version>@MusicScience37Projects+utility-libraries+cpp-stat-bench/stable`
with a version you want
to your `conanfile.py` or `conanfile.txt`,
and add the remote
`https://gitlab.com/api/v4/packages/conan`
to conan command.

## How to Build in this Repository

To build this repository,
you will require following dependencies:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.9
  - You may want to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org)
  - Required Python packages can be installed using poetry.
    Execute the command `poetry install` on this directory.
  - [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
    will be installed via poetry, and used for some checks.
    Execute `poetry run pre-commit install` on this directory
    if you develop this library.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- C++ 14 Compiler
  - Following compilers are tested in CI:
    - GCC 10
    - Clang 14
    - MSVC 19

Additionally, you will require following dependencies
to build documentation.

- [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html)
- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com)
  - Set `PLANTUML_JAR_PATH` environment variable to specify the place of `plantuml.jar` file.
- Java runtime environment (JRE) for PlantUML

After installing the above dependencies,
execute the following commands:

1. Start a shell of poetry.

   ```bash
   cd <this-directory>
   poetry install
   poetry shell
   ```

2. Add the Conan remote in GitLab. (Once in an environment.)

   ```bash
   conan remote add gitlab https://gitlab.com/api/v4/packages/conan
   ```

3. Download and install required Conan packages.

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   conan install --build missing ..
   ```

4. Configure.

   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

5. Optionally edit options.

   ```bash
   <some-editor> CMakeCache.txt
   ```

6. Build.

   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```

7. Optionally run tests.

   ```bash
   ctest
   ```
