## Installation

### Via vcpkg

This library can be installed via vcpkg using following configurations:

- Add a vcpkg registry
  `https://gitlab.com/MusicScience37Projects/vcpkg-registry`
  in `vcpkg-configuration.json`.

  Example:

  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/main/docs/vcpkg-configuration.schema.json",
    "default-registry": {
      "kind": "git",
      "repository": "https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg",
      "baseline": "099fb9250d916511782bf5215f01f2e7141beb3a"
    },
    "registries": [
      {
        "kind": "git",
        "repository": "https://gitlab.com/MusicScience37Projects/vcpkg-registry",
        "baseline": "fb3ea2e761fca69a7e9cf0a447538792d0cc6057",
        "packages": ["cpp-msgpack-light", "cpp-stat-bench"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- Add `cpp-stat-bench` in `vcpkg.json`

  Example:

  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/main/docs/vcpkg.schema.json",
    "dependencies": ["cpp-stat-bench"]
  }
  ```

## How to Build in this Repository

To build this repository,
you will require following dependencies:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.12
  - You may want to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org)
  - Required Python packages can be installed using poetry.
    Execute the command `poetry install` on this directory.
  - [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
    will be installed via poetry, and used for some checks.
    Execute `poetry run pre-commit install` on this directory
    if you develop this library.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- C++ 14 Compiler
  - Following compilers are tested in CI:
    - GCC 12
    - Clang 18
    - MSVC 19

Additionally, you will require following dependencies
to build documentation.

- [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html)
- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com)
  - Set `PLANTUML_JAR_PATH` environment variable to specify the place of `plantuml.jar` file.
- Java runtime environment (JRE) for PlantUML

After installing the above dependencies,
execute the following commands:

1. Start a shell of poetry.

   ```bash
   cd <this-directory>
   poetry install
   poetry shell
   ```

2. Download vcpkg if you haven't already.

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init
   ```

3. Build vcpkg.

   - On Windows:

     ```bat
     .\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
     ```

   - On Linux:

     ```bash
     ./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
     ```

4. Configure.

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
   ```

5. Optionally edit options.

   ```bash
   <some-editor> CMakeCache.txt
   ```

6. Build.

   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```
